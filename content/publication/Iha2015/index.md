# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Morphological identification of species in the order Gelidiales can be difficult and controversial because of phenotypic plasticity, the low numbers of reproductive specimens and poorly defined taxonomic boundaries. A DNA barcoding survey of Brazilian specimens of Gelidiales, employing neighbor-joining and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery analyses, indicated the presence of 23 statistically robust primary species hypotheses (PSH). In addition to the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI-5P), the chloroplast universal plastid amplicon (UPA) marker was also sequenced and submitted to the same analyses. Representatives of each COI-5P/UPA PSH were selected for *rbcL* sequence analysis to further corroborate the occurrence of 23 species and to infer their phylogenetic relationships. These analyses confirmed the identity of six species previously cited for Brazil: *Gelidiella acerosa*, *G. ligulata*, *Gelidium crinale*, *G. floridanum*, *Pterocladiella bartlettii* and *P. capillacea*. Three new reports for Brazil were also detected: *Gelidium microdonticum*, *Pterocladiella beachiae* and *P. australafricanensis*. Fourteen species remain unidentified and require detailed morphological evaluation.
